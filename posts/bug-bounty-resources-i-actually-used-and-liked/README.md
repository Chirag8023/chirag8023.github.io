In cyber security or bug bounty there are so many things to explore and learn, that can be overwhelming.

So after a few exploration and figuring out what I require, i create a list to reduce that noise.

`üçü(tip) : here is my list but i would really suggest you to explore things and make your own list.`


**\* = fully free**

**\*\* = partially free**


- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames) * : The best starting point. It have wargames ( cyber-security challenges and mind sports ) that push us to develop research skills that help in real world too.

- [PentesterLab Recon Badge](https://pentesterlab.com/badges/recon) ** : Recon is important skill in Bug Bounty. It have good challenges that teaches recon. 

- [Web Security Academy by PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security) * : Constantly updated online training center for web application security. It includes interactive labs, Good for bug bounty hunter and pentester.

## Useful Repositories

- [10000-h1-disclosed-reports](https://github.com/shreyaschavhan/10000-h1-disclosed-reports) * : This repo have links to 10,000 hackerone reports, reading these reports is really useful to progress in the bug bounty journey. It's suggested to read at least 5000 reports.

- [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) * : A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security. Again super useful in the bug bounty process.
